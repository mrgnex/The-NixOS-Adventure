## What is NixOS?
NixOS is an immutable and declarative Linux based operating system. This means that the core system cannot be easily changed and is this case is changed through a configuration file containing code which tells the system what to do.  
This provides an easy and reliable way to configure a system but also allows tracking and sharing of the configuration file. The main benefit is that this configuration is seperate from hardware. This means any configuration should work with any system.  
Deployments become a breeze but it also means the configuration can be shared between people and even can be used after reinstalling. It is also very robust since after every change a new snapshot of the system is made.  
In short, the way NixOS works allows for very robust and durable way to run the operating system.
